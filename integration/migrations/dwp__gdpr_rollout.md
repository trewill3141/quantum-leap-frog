### GDPR Compliance Rollout

## Company 
Dream World Partners 

## Problem 
Global dating website with millions of users across European markets required comprehensive GDPR compliance implementation to meet regulatory requirements, including consent management, data subject rights (access, deletion, portability), and privacy policy enforcement across 15+ countries.

## Solution
Designed and implemented a GDPR-compliant data infrastructure that includes consent management platforms (OneTrust/TrustArc), data subject rights automation via API workflows, and privacy policy enforcement mechanisms. Developed automated workflows using Python and Airflow for handling data access requests (DSAR), deletion requests, and consent withdrawal processes with 30-day SLA compliance.

Integrated consent tracking and data minimization principles across all data collection and processing activities (analytics, marketing, user profiles). Built automated systems to honor user privacy preferences in real-time and ensure compliance with GDPR requirements across European markets, including cookie consent management and data retention policies.

All GDPR-related processes are logged in audit databases (Snowflake/BigQuery) and auditable for compliance verification and regulatory reporting.
