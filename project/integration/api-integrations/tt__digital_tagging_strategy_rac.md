### Digital Tagging Strategy

## Company 
Tandem Theory 

## Client
Rent-A-Center

## Problem 
Client lacked comprehensive digital tagging strategy to capture user interactions and events across web properties, resulting in incomplete data collection and limited analytics capabilities for optimization and reporting.

## Solution
Developed and implemented comprehensive digital tagging strategy using Google Tag Manager (GTM) to capture user interactions, events (page views, clicks, form submissions, video interactions), and conversions (e-commerce transactions, lead submissions) across all web properties. Created tag deployment documentation (tagging plan, data layer spec) and governance processes (review workflows, testing protocols) to ensure consistent implementation across 50+ web pages.

Built event tracking specifications (event naming conventions, parameter structure) and GTM container configurations (triggers, tags, variables) that enable detailed user journey analysis. Integrated tag management with Google Analytics 360 and BigQuery via Enhanced Ecommerce events to ensure data flows correctly for reporting and analysis, including custom dimensions for business context.

All tagging implementations include data validation and quality checks (GTM Preview mode testing, GA Real-Time reports validation, BigQuery data quality queries) to ensure accurate data collection with >99% accuracy.
