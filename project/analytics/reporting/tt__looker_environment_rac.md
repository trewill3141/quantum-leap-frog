### Looker Environment Buildout

## Company 
Tandem Theory 

## Client
Rent-A-Center

## Problem 
Client required recreation of 200 Adobe Suite reports in Looker after migrating from Adobe Analytics to GA360, necessitating comprehensive Looker environment setup and dashboard development to maintain existing reporting capabilities.

## Solution
Built comprehensive Looker environment with data models and dashboards to replicate 200 Adobe Suite reports. Developed LookML models on top of BigQuery to organize data and define business logic (measures, dimensions, explores), enabling self-service analytics capabilities for 50+ users.

Created dashboard templates and reports that maintain functional parity with existing Adobe Suite reports while leveraging Looker's interactive visualization capabilities (drill-downs, filters, custom visualizations). Implemented user access controls via Looker Groups and data governance (row-level security) to ensure appropriate data visibility across departments (marketing, product, finance).

All Looker content (200+ views, 30+ dashboards, 100+ explores) is documented and version-controlled via Git for maintenance and updates.
