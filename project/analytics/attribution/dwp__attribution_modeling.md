### Attribution Modeling for Digital Ad Spend

## Company 
Dream World Partners 

## Problem 
Client lacked comprehensive attribution modeling capabilities to accurately measure and optimize digital advertising spend across multiple channels (search, display, social, email) and touchpoints, resulting in inefficient budget allocation and unclear ROI visibility across a multi-million dollar annual ad spend.

## Solution
Developed a multi-touch attribution model leveraging data science and analytics to track customer journeys across digital channels. Implemented advanced attribution methodologies (last-click, first-click, linear, time-decay, and position-based models) to identify the true impact of each marketing touchpoint on conversions and revenue.

Built data pipelines using Python and SQL to aggregate ad spend and conversion data from Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and other advertising platforms into BigQuery, enabling analysis of marketing effectiveness and identification of underperforming channels. The model provides actionable insights for budget reallocation and campaign optimization with ROI calculations and channel contribution analysis.

All attribution data is integrated into reporting dashboards (Data Studio/Google Analytics) with drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis by channel, campaign, and customer segment.
