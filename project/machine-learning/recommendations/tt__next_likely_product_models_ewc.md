### Next Likely Product Models

## Company 
Tandem Theory 

## Client
European Wax Center

## Problem 
Client lacked predictive models to identify which services or products customers are most likely to purchase next, limiting opportunities for personalized service recommendations and upselling in both digital and in-store channels.

## Solution
Developed machine learning models to predict next likely service purchases based on customer visit history (appointment frequency, time since last visit), service preferences (waxing type, add-on services), and seasonal patterns (holiday trends, appointment cadence). Implemented recommendation algorithms tailored to personal services industry (collaborative filtering, sequential pattern mining) that rank services by customer likelihood.

Built scoring infrastructure using Python that generates personalized service recommendations for marketing campaigns (email, SMS) and booking platform personalization via API integration. The models incorporate customer lifetime value, service frequency patterns (regular, occasional, lapsed customers), and cross-service relationships (bundle recommendations, upselling opportunities) to improve prediction accuracy with precision@5 >0.30.

All models are continuously trained on new booking and purchase data (weekly retraining) and evaluated for performance and relevance (A/B testing, conversion lift analysis).
