### Digital Ad Spend Forecasting

## Company 
Tandem Theory 

## Client
Rent-A-Center

## Problem 
Client lacked predictive forecasting capabilities for digital ad spend optimization, requiring manual budget planning and making it difficult to project performance and ROI for marketing campaigns.

## Solution
Developed predictive forecasting models using historical ad spend and performance data (2+ years of daily data across Google Ads, Facebook Ads, display networks) to project future campaign outcomes and optimize budget allocation. Implemented machine learning approaches (ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost) to identify patterns and trends in advertising performance, including seasonality, day-of-week effects, and competitive factors.

Built automated forecasting workflows using Python and Airflow that generate weekly/monthly budget recommendations and performance projections based on historical data, seasonality, and market trends. The system provides scenario planning capabilities (what-if analysis) to evaluate different budget allocation strategies across channels with ROI projections.

All forecasting models include validation metrics (MAPE <15%, R² >0.85) and confidence intervals (80% and 95%) for reliability assessment, with automated model retraining on a weekly basis.
