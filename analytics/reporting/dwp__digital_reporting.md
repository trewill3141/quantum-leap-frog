### Digital Reporting Platform

## Company 
Dream World Partners 

## Problem 
Client lacked centralized digital reporting capabilities, requiring manual data aggregation from multiple sources (Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, Google Ads, email platforms) and resulting in time-consuming weekly report generation with potential for errors and inconsistencies across 10+ reports.

## Solution
Architected a centralized digital reporting platform that automates data collection from multiple digital marketing channels via APIs and provides unified dashboards and reports. Implemented ETL processes using Python and SQL to standardize data formats and enable cross-channel analysis in BigQuery.

Developed automated reporting workflows using Airflow that generate scheduled weekly/monthly reports and real-time dashboards in Data Studio, reducing manual effort from 8+ hours per week to near-zero and ensuring data consistency. The platform includes customizable templates for different stakeholder needs (executive, marketing, operations) and automated distribution mechanisms via email and Slack.

All reporting infrastructure includes data validation and quality checks (missing data alerts, data freshness monitoring) to ensure accuracy and reliability.
