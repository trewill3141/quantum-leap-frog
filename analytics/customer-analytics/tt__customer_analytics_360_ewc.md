### Customer Analytics 360

## Company 
Tandem Theory 

## Client
European Wax Center

## Problem 
Client lacked unified customer analytics capabilities to integrate online booking data, in-store visit data, and customer profile information, preventing comprehensive customer journey analysis and limiting personalization opportunities.

## Solution
Implemented Customer Analytics 360 (CA360) solution to create unified customer profiles by integrating online booking data (website, mobile app), in-store transactions (POS systems), and customer profile information (CRM data). Developed data pipelines using Python and Airflow to merge customer touchpoints across digital and physical channels via identity resolution (email, phone, membership ID matching).

Built customer segmentation models specific to personal services industry (visit frequency, service preferences, seasonal patterns, lifetime value) to enable targeted marketing and customer retention strategies. The CA360 implementation provides comprehensive customer insights (appointment history, service mix, retention risk scores) that inform marketing campaigns (email, SMS) and customer experience optimization via Looker dashboards.

All customer data integration follows privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) and data governance standards (PII encryption, access controls, consent management).
