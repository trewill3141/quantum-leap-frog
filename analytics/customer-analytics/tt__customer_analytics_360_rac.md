## Problem 
Client lacked unified customer analytics capabilities to integrate online and offline customer data, preventing comprehensive customer journey analysis and limiting personalization and marketing optimization opportunities.

## Solution
Implemented Customer Analytics 360 (CA360) solution to create unified customer profiles by integrating online (website, mobile app) and offline (in-store transactions, call center) data sources. Developed data pipelines using Python and Airflow to merge customer touchpoints via identity resolution (email, phone, address matching) and create comprehensive customer views with 360-degree profiles.

Built customer segmentation models (RFM analysis, behavioral clusters) and lifetime value models (CLV prediction using machine learning) to enable targeted marketing and personalization. The CA360 implementation provides 360-degree customer insights (purchase history, channel preferences, engagement metrics) that inform marketing strategy and customer experience optimization via Looker dashboards.

All customer data integration follows privacy and data governance best practices (PII encryption, access controls, data retention policies).
