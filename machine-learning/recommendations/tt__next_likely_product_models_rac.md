### Next Likely Product Models

## Company 
Tandem Theory 

## Client
Rent-A-Center

## Problem 
Client lacked predictive models to identify which products customers are most likely to rent or purchase next, limiting opportunities for personalized product recommendations and cross-selling initiatives.

## Solution
Developed machine learning models to predict next likely product purchases based on customer behavior (browsing history, search queries), purchase history (rental patterns, product categories), and product attributes (category, price point, popularity). Implemented recommendation algorithms (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid approaches) that rank products by likelihood of customer interest.

Built scoring infrastructure using Python that generates real-time product recommendations for marketing campaigns (email, push notifications) and website personalization via API integration. The models incorporate collaborative filtering (matrix factorization), content-based filtering (item similarity), and feature engineering (customer-product interactions, temporal features) to improve prediction accuracy with precision@10 >0.25.

All models are continuously trained on new transaction data (weekly retraining) and evaluated for performance and accuracy (A/B testing, offline evaluation metrics).

## Technology
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- Machine learning frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- SQL (BigQuery)
